# mspdebug 0.25

The mspdebug tool has been compiled on Fedora and Windows 10 to create these binaries. You can find more info on mspdebug [here](https://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/) & you can get the source [here](https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug).

To compile it in linux I executed `make` command in the source directory. To compile it in Windows 10 before running `make` I had to edit some things in Makefile, find more info [here](https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug/issues/101#issuecomment-760713289).

##### Updates:

1. The manually compiled mspdebug for Linux has been replaced with the mspdebug from Energia (energia-1.8.10E23/hardware/tools/mspdebug/mspdebug). The previous binary required some extra library but, the recent binary is standalone. Thanks to Energia project team!
2. Mac OSx binary is taken directly from Energia.
